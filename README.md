• I have designed a circuit that consists of 6 servo motors and 6 potentiometers.
  
• Each potentiometer is used to control the angular position of one servo motor, ranging from 0 to 180 degrees.

•I utilized a voltage regulator to maintain a 5-volt supply.


The circuit operates effectively, accurately responding to programmed commands. 🚀
