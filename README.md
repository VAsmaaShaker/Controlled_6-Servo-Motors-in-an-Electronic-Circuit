# 🕹️Controlled_6-Servo-Motors-in-an-Electronic-Circuit

Successfully connected and programmed an electronic circuit featuring 6 servo motors using C++ in Tinkercad's virtual simulation. 🤖

Achieved complete control over the servo motors' movement from 0 to 180 degrees and back using an Arduino board. The rotation was achieved with the line:
 "for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1)" , in reverse with the opposite signal.

The circuit operates effectively, accurately responding to programmed commands. 🚀
